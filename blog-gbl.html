                                    Games have been present from a long time in all cultures. They are played solely for
                                    enjoyment purpose. However playing games has numerous benefits such as improving
                                    patience, problem-solving, social skills, strategizing, etc. Let’s see how
                                    inculcating games in learning improves the learning process!

                                </p>

                                <blockquote style="padding: 20px; text-align:left;">

                                        What is Game-Based Learning (GBL) ?
                                    </p>
                                </blockquote>

                                <p>
                                    Game-Based Learning is the use of game elements with educational goals to support a
                                    student’s growth and development. The GBL technique focuses on teaching through
                                    failure, repetition and accomplishment of goals. In games, a player usually starts
                                    with easy levels and gradually attains mastery. While attaining mastery the player
                                    may fail and might have to repeat the level, learn from the mistakes made in that
                                    level. In learning too, this method can be applied.
                                </p>


                                <p>Students work on their goal, choose their actions and learn from the consequences of
                                    their actions. This results in active learning rather than passive learning. In a
                                    GBL environment, students learn new concepts and can practice their skills in a
                                    risk-free setting. Their progress in the game is directly related to their
                                    understanding of the subject being taught.</p>

                                </h3>
                                <p>
                                    Students still play board games, card games, and many others. These tend to
                                    emphasize strategy elements rather than being completely random games of chance.
                                    Monopoly can be considered an educational game. It has all the necessary elements: a
                                    story, characters, points, competition, and many other aspects. There are many
                                    examples of Monopoly-like games for schools with modified rules for different
                                    subjects, like History Monopoly or Math Monopoly. </p>

                                <h3>2. Digital Games</h3>
                                <p>
                                    A digital game does not involve skills that are connected to the use of the body and
                                    the real space, but it can train students to collaborate in a different and virtual
                                    way. In this type of game, students can be involved in the construction of the game,
                                    especially if the teacher is not able to manage online tools without their help.
                                    Students have a character (but not necessarily an account) that moves through the
                                    game where they face challenges that are placed along the games’ path.
                                    <br>Examples: Universe Sandbox, Minecraft, Math Blaster, etc.

                                </p>
                                <h3>3. Real life Games</h3>
                                <p>
                                    This is probably the most motivating, but also the most stressful type of game. In
                                    this kind, students must move, act, use their body and their minds in order to play.
                                    This is the most immersive type and it provokes students in almost every aspect of
                                    their learning.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    Since there is the possibility to move into a certain space, the real life game is
                                    often connected to the theatre. It’s easy to find role play activities, as well as
                                    simulations or drama in this type of game learning. Students act “as if they were” a
                                    character of the game, make decisions according to their goals, the environment, and
                                    the rules.

                                    • <b>Motivation</b> <br>Motivation is the key to good teaching and learning flow in
                                    the classroom. For this reason, GBL is very effective, as games are naturally
                                    motivating and engaging. Moreover, games provide something that can be described as
                                    “far from a traditional lesson” and they are often include competition among
                                    students; which can raise the level of motivation in a classroom.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    • <b>Self confidence</b> <br>As students are appreciated more, they feel a sense of
                                    accomplishment and hence this boosts their self confidence.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    • <b>Enhances real world skills</b> <br>As GBL promotes ‘learn by doing’, students
                                    understand the real world applications better.
                                </p>

                                    • <b>Memory</b> <br>GBL is known to sharpen the student’s memory as learning
                                    concepts through visual leads to better retention power. It also leads to decrease
                                    in the learning time and faster concept grabbing for students.

                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    • <b>Creativity</b> <br>GBL and games are effective tools for fostering creativity,
                                    especially if students are involved in the construction of the game. Imagination has
                                    no limits.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    • <b>Team work</b> <br>It is not difficult to understand why a game is highly
                                    suitable for team and group work. Unity is strength and everyone loses or wins when
                                    they play a game together.
