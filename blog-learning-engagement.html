									There are many tools and frameworks available for gamification designers to help them
									with their designs. The most useful of those frameworks is knowing the user/player
									type. Let’s look at these types and what motivates them, for a better learning
									experience!

										Bartle’s Four Player Types
									</p>
								</blockquote>

								<p>
									In the 1990s, Dr Richard Bartle outlined 4 basic types of game players . These are
									the Achievers, the Socializers, the Explorers and the Killers. In his framework, he
									describes how they interact with the game and with each other. We’re going to look
									at these 4 types of game players, and show you how to design gamified learning
									experiences for each one of them.
								</p>

								<blockquote style="padding: 20px; text-align:left;">
									<p style="font-style:normal; font-weight:600; font-size: 30px;">
										Achievers
									</p>
								</blockquote>

								<p>
									Achievers are all about points and status. They want to be able to show their
									friends how they are progressing. They like to collect badges and put them on
									display.<br>
									Bartle estimates that roughly 10% of people are players of the Achiever type.
									Chances are you will know several people of this sort; someone who boasts he used a
									quicker route to get to a destination than his friend did, is an Achiever type.

									<br></p>
								<p style="padding-left: 2%">
									<b>Gamified Learning for Achievers -</b><br>

									The thirst for challenge is the main driver for Achievers. You need to ensure that
									there are enough challenges to satisfy them, and that they get more difficult as the
									player progresses. In this case, a microlearning approach is ideal, as it lets you
									break your content down into smaller, bite-sized pieces.<br>

									Allow them to show off their achievements and badges. The best way to do this is to
									display their badge collection on their profile page, letting other Achievers easily
									find out what their own collection is missing.

								</p>

								<blockquote style="padding: 20px; text-align:left;">
									<p style="font-style:normal; font-weight:600; font-size: 30px;">
										Explorers
									</p>
								</blockquote>

								<p>
									Explorers want to see new things and discover new secrets. They’re not as bothered about points or
									prizes. For them, discovery is the prize. Explorers are fine with repetitive tasks.<br>
									Explorers really enjoy the surprise that’s possible in a game, and around 10% of players fit into this
									category. These are the players who will feel at walls in a game in order to access a secret passage;
									their satisfaction on doing so is what makes them tick, not bragging to their friends about their
									discovery.
									<br></p>
								<p style="padding-left: 2%">
									<b>Gamified Learning for Explorers -</b><br>

									Most of the Explorers using Learning Management System will be happy to privately browse the content
									at their own pace. It’s up to you to build an exciting journey for them, full of twists and turns. 
									<br>
									As the self-appointed map-makers on your platform, Explorers are your content curators, and they might
									even unveil themselves as Subject Matter Experts. Give them the tools they need to leave notes and
									signposts for those that follow them. Rating and reviewing functionality lets them suggest edits,
									point to additional content and flag up anything they found particularly useful. 

								</p>

								<blockquote style="padding: 20px; text-align:left;">
									<p style="font-style:normal; font-weight:600; font-size: 30px;">
										Socializers
									</p>
								</blockquote>

								<p>
									The vast majority of players are Socializers. That’s almost 80% of people who play games. Socializers
									experience fun in their games through their interaction with other players. Socializers are happy to
									collaborate in order to achieve bigger and better things than they could on their own.
									<br>Socializers are happy to come to the rescue. When they have nobody to help, Socializers will
									happily congratulate other gamers on their successes, share their opinions, and perhaps even spark the
									odd heated discussion.

									<br></p>
								<p style="padding-left: 2%">
									<b>Gamified Learning for Socializers -</b><br>

									They like to work in groups, to share answers with others, to be a part of a team. They need to feel
									meaningful for the group and good at the role they have inside the group. Otherwise, they can feel
									like they failed the entire group, which can make the socializer feel a sense of guilt.
									<br>
									This kind of learner likes to do a study group and solve things together. So, designing a learning
									process for a group with lots of socializers, is not only to make them work in groups but also give
									them a meaningful role as a part of the group.
								</p>

								<blockquote style="padding: 20px; text-align:left;">
									<p style="font-style:normal; font-weight:600; font-size: 30px;">
										Killers
									</p>
								</blockquote>

								<p>
									Killers are similar to Achievers in the way that they get a thrill from gaining points and winning
									status too. What sets them apart from Achievers is that the Killers want to see other people lose. You
									may expect this personality type to be common, but Bartle’s research suggests that only a small number
									of players are Killers – less than 1% to be precise.


									<br></p>
								<p style="padding-left: 2%">
									<b>Gamified Learning for Killers -</b><br>

									Killers are the most difficult type to keep motivated. They won’t spend their time on extra activity
									because it’s in their way to victory, and they will lose interest when they see someone else already
									got the first place.
									<br>
									It’s better to create a few different kinds of scores and paths to excel in order to give them lots of
									opportunities to shine. Another way is creating a dynamic leaderboard in which the first place can be
									changed. Otherwise, as soon as one got the first place, they will lose interest in the material.
